                            Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. 
                            It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be 
                            accessed and updated efficiently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Depending on your requirement and project, it is important to choose 
                            the right data structure for your project. For example, if you want 
                            to store data sequentially in the memory, then you can go for the 
                            Array data structure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Linear data structure: the elements are arranged in sequence one 
                                after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, 
                                they are easy to implement.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Non-linear data structure: the elements are not in any sequence. 
                                Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one 
                                element will be connected to one or more elements.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. 
                            Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of 
                            significant indentation. A high-level programming language is a programming 
                            language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. An 
                            interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions 
                            written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them 
                            previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. A 
                            general-purpose programming language (GPL) is a programming language 
                            designed to be used for building software in a wide variety of application 
                            domains, across a multitude of hardware configurations and operating systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Its core philosophy is summarized as:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
                            <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
                            <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
                            <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
                            <li>Readability counts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            We will make use of this philosophy throughout this documentation.

                            Python supports integers, floating-point numbers and complex numbers. 
                            They are defined as <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, and 
                            <code>complex</code> classes in Python.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Integers and floating points are separated by the presence or absence 
                            of a decimal point. For instance, 5 is an integer whereas 5.0 is a 
                            floating-point number.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Complex numbers are written in the form, <code>x + yj</code>, where 
                            <code>x</code> is the real part and <code>y</code> is the imaginary part.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The number data structure can be used to store any value and mathematical 
                            operations such as addition, substractions, division and multiplication can
                            be done with them.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here is an example:</p>
                        <code>an_int = 5
                            a_float = 5.0
                            a_complex = 5 + 5j
                        </code>

                        <p>
                            Python lists are one of the most versatile data types that allow us to work 
                            with multiple elements at once. In Python, a list is created by placing 
                            elements inside square brackets <code>[]</code>, separated by commas. A list 
                            can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, 
                            float, etc.). A list can also have another list as an item. This is called a 
                            nested list.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are various ways in which we can access the elements of a list, mainly
                            indexing and slicing. The operations that can be done on a list are: add, 
                            change and delete elements.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are examples of implementation of a list:</p>
                        <code># declare an empty List
                            empty_list = []

                            # declare a list with elements
                            a_list = [1, 2.0, 3 + 4j]

                            # Access the first element in a List
                            first_element = a_list[0]    # 1

                            # Select all elements after the first one
                            other_element = a_list[1:]   # [2.0, 3 + 4j]

                            # Add an element to a List
                            empty_list.append(5)         # [5]

                            # Change an element of the List
                            a_list[2] = 6 + 7j           # [1, 2.0, 6 +7j]

                            # Delete an element from the List
                            del a_list[2]                # [1, 2.0]

                    <article>
                        <p>
                            A tuple in Python is similar to a list. The difference between the two is that 
                            we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas we can 
                            change the elements of a list.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses <code>()</code>, 
                            separated by commas. The parentheses are optional, however, it is a good practice 
                            to use them. A tuple can have any number of items and they may be of different 
                            types (integer, float, list, etc.).
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are some examples of tuples with the same operations as with list:</p>
                        <code># declare an empty Tuple
                            empty_tuple = ()

                            # declare a Tuple with one element
                            one_tuple = (1,)

                            # declare a Tuple with elements
                            a_tuple = (1, 2, 4.5, 8 + 9j, [0, 3])

                            # Access the first element in a List
                            first_element = a_tuple[0]       # (1,)

                            # Select last 2 elements
                            other_element = a_tuple[1:]      # (8 + 9j, [0, 3])

                            # Add an element
                            new_tuple = first_element + (2)  # (1, 2)

                            # Delete an element
                            del a_tuple                      # 'a_tuple' is not defined
                        </code>

                            A string is a sequence of characters. A character is simply a symbol. For 
                            example, the English language has 26 characters. Computers do not deal with 
                            characters, they deal with numbers (binary). Even though you may see 
                            characters on your screen, internally it is stored and manipulated as a 
                            combination of 0s and 1s. This conversion of character to a number is called 
                            encoding, and the reverse process is decoding. ASCII and Unicode are some of 
                            the popular encodings used. In Python, a string is a sequence of Unicode 
                            characters. Unicode was introduced to include every character in all 
                            languages and bring uniformity in encoding. You can learn about Unicode from 
                            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/howto/unicode.html" target="_blank">

                            Strings can be created by enclosing characters inside a single quote or 
                            double-quotes. Even triple quotes can be used in Python but generally used to 
                            represent multiline strings and docstrings. We can access individual characters 
                            using indexing and a range of characters using slicing just like with lists. 
                            Strings are immutable like tuples, the elements can't be changed nor deleted.

                            The example here will focus on the iterability of string which can be apply to
                            almost all the data structure on this documentation besides numbers.

                            A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique 
                            (no duplicates) and must be immutable (cannot be changed: integers, strings, 
                            etc.). However, a set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it. 
                            Sets can also be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, 
                            intersection, symmetric difference, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces 
                            <code>{}</code>, separated by comma, or by using the built-in 
                            <code>set()</code> function. Sets are mutable. However, since they are 
                            unordered, indexing has no meaning. We cannot access or change an element 
                            of a set using indexing or slicing. Set data type does not support it. We 
                            can add a single element using the <code>add()</code> method, and multiple 
                            elements using the <code>update()</code> method. The <code>update()</code> 
                            method can take tuples, lists, strings or other sets as its argument. In 
                            all cases, duplicates are avoided.

                        <p>Here are examples of sets and some operations specific to them:</p>
                        <code># set of mixed datatypes

                            # add an element
                            my_set.add(2)                           # {1.0, (1, 2, 3), 'Hello', 2}

                            # initialize A and B
                            A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
                            B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

                        <p>
                            Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Each item of a 
                            dictionary has a <code>key/value</code> pair. Dictionaries are optimized 
                            to retrieve values when the key is known.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Creating a dictionary is as simple as placing items inside curly braces 
                            <code>{}</code> separated by commas. An item has a <code>key</code> and 
                            a corresponding <code>value</code> that is expressed as a pair 
                            (<strong>key: value</strong>). While the values can be of any data type 
                            and can repeat, keys must be of immutable type (string, number or tuple 
                            with immutable elements) and must be unique.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While indexing is used with other data types to access values, a 
                            dictionary uses <code>keys</code>. Keys can be used either inside square 
                            brackets <code>[]</code> or with the <code>get()</code> method. 
                            Dictionaries are mutable. We can add new items or change the value of 
                            existing items using an assignment operator. We can remove a particular 
                            item in a dictionary by using the <code>pop()</code> method. This method 
                            removes an item with the provided <code>key</code> and returns the 
                            <code>value</code>. We can also use the <code>del</code> keyword to remove 
                            individual items or the entire dictionary itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are examples of dictionary:</p>
                        <code># empty dictionary
                            my_dict = {}

                            # dictionary with mixed keys
                            my_dict = {'apples': 10, 'name': 'John', 1: [2, 4, 3]} # {'apples': 10, 'name': 'John', 1: [2, 4, 3]}

                            # [] for retrieving elements
                            my_dict['name']                                        # 'John'

                            # get for retrieving elements
                            my_dict.get('apples')                                  # 10

                            # add item
                            my_dict['address'] = 'Downtown'                        # {'apples': 10, 'name': 'John', 1: [2, 4, 3], 'address': 'Downtown'}
                        
                            # remove a particular item, returns its value
                            my_dict.pop(1)                                         # {'apples': 10, 'name': 'John', 'address': 'Downtown'}
                        
                            # delete the dictionary itself
                            del my_dict
